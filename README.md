## Tips:
Following are some tips for every coding interview: 

- Understand the question completely. Re-confirm the question with the interviewer.
- Clarify few things like: Tree is BT or BST, Array contains negative numbers or not, String is case-sensitive or not, Array is sorted or not etc.
- Keep explaining whatever comes to your mind.
- Write indented and modular code (write functions wherever possible i.e you can save time)
- Add valid comments to your code
- Cover edge cases
- Check your code yourself first and then confirm the interviewer
- Dry run your code even if the interviewer doesnâ€™t ask you to do so
